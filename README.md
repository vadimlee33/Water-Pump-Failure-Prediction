# Water Pump Failure Prediction
## Project overview
The goal of the project is to predict the failure of a water pump that experienced frequent failures during the spring and summer of 2018.

The dataset for this project was collected from the pump and consists of 52 sensors that measure various physical properties of the system.

## Tools
In this project we use a lot of different libraries.
#### For model training we use Machine Learning Algorithms and Deep Learning(ANN)
- We use Machine Learning Algorithms from open-source library scikit-learn.
- In case of Deep Learning we use TensorFlow.
